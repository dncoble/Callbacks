# Callbacks

This repo was initially made to store custom `keras` callbacks which I had written, for my own reference. Now, I'm filling it with any section of code which I find myself repeatedly coming back to. I'm keeping the name though, because it almost works as a pun.


All functions have been tested for `keras` 2.10.0 and `numpy` 1.19.5.
